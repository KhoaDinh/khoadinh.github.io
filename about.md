Hi, My name is Khoa. 

I am a developer with a passion for beautifully crafted softwares. Currently I work as a senior developer at [Precio](http://www.precio.se/en) where I work mainly with .NET technologies. On my free time, I love to play around with open source stuffs and practice my programming skill. I live in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

On this blog I write mostly about software development with a wide variety of topics like architecture, scalability, progamming languages, databases. Sometimes I write about my other hobbies including books, [Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29) and traveling.
