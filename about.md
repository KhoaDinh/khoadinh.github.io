title: About Me
---

My name is Khoa Dinh. I am a developer with a passion for beautifully crafted softwares. Currently I work as a senior developer at [Precio](http://www.precio.se/en) where I work mainly with .NET technologies. I live in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

On this blog I write mostly about software development with a wide variety of topics like architecture, scalability, JavaScript, NoSQL, NodeJS. Sometimes I write about my other hobbies including books, [Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29) and traveling.
