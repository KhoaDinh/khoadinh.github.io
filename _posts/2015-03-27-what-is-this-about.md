Hello and welcome to the first post of this blog (hopefully there will be many more to come).

So, what is this blog about?  
Well, this blog is mainly a place for [me]({{ site.BASE_PATH}}/{{ site.about_path }}) to write down my thoughts and what I have learnt throughout my journey as a developer. Writing everything down help me to keep track and organize my ideas. Comparing to keeping things in a lot of notebooks lying around everywhere, like I used to do, keeping it in an online blog would be much more convenient. Also, this way my knowledge could be useful for people who might needs them.


What can you expect to find here?  
Most of the contents will be about web development and programming. Here are some typical posts you will see in this blog:  
- Polyglot persistence - when should we use NoSQL?
- Applying Functional Reactive Programming to large JavaScript projects
- Building isomorphic JavaScript app with NodeJS
- Token-based authentication with AngularJS

Finally, in case you're wondering, this blog's name is from [Franz Kafka's famous story](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5200/5200-h/5200-h.htm)

Enjoy reading!
